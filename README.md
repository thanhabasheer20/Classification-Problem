# Classification-Problem

The objective of this assessment is to apply supervised learning techniques to a real-world dataset.

Dataset:

Use the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library.

Key components fulfilled:

1. Loaded and preprocessed dataset.

  Loaded the breast cancer dataset from sklearn.
  Preprocessed the data and checked for missing values and  capped outliers using IQR and performed necessary feature scaling

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation.

 Implemented the following five classification algorithms:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Decision Tree Classifier

3. Random Forest Classifier

4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)

5. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

For each algorithm, provided a brief description of how it works and why it might be suitable for this dataset.


3. Model Comparison 

Compared the performance of the five classification algorithms.
Found out Best performing and worst performing models.
